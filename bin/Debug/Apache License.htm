and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the
Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work

licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed. <o:p></o:p></p>

modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for

License. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b>5. Submission of Contributions</b>.
Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms
of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
such Contributions. <o:p></o:p></p>

NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
permissions under this License. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><b>8. Limitation of Liability</b>.
In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages. <o:p></o:p></p>

Additional Liability</b>. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works
thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on
Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability. <o:p></o:p></p>
